After reading a text about AI and cybernetic in another class, I got really interested in the project name Eliza. Created by Joseph Weizenbaum in 1964, this artificial intelligence was intented to reproduce human conversation, just like a psychologist will have with his patient. Weizenbaum has discover with his research that human, even if they understand that this is a machine and they are talking to a computer, confessed really easily. Even the secretary of Weizenbaum that was their along the process got really into it and wanted privacy with the machine. After reading this the experiment, people realize three things between the interaction of a computer and a human, but the most important of them all was how easy people got honest with a machine. Today, we have a lot of debat about the place of technology should have in our society. It is everywhere surrounding us, we can't really go without it. In science fiction movie, we always have the classic subject that robots are going to take over the world. With the text of Eliza in mind, I have decided to make a game mixing these two things together.

Named "Break Eliza", the player has in front of him a chatbox. The bot, aka the machine, the brain, the version of Eliza, is making a first contact with the player. The scenario then goes on on basic question like "how are your" or "what is your name" just to establish the more human contact type of communication. With the clock going on, there the player can be distracted set up in the instructions and lose, which means not have been able to break eliza. To help the player a little, there is some clues that goins to appear at different time during the game, maybe to help him, maybe just told him something he already knows. If the player is persistent enough and ask the right question correctly, the scenario in the brain.rive file is going to go to the end, which is the breaking point. The screen and all the components on the window is going to break. The game end there.

This project was a real challenge for me. I decided to try something new, something we did not cover in class. Rivescript is a library that make a discussion more easy to do. You can plan in advance the answers, get more interaction with the input of the player and the ability of rivescript to keep in memory the informations said before. The script was hard to do first of all, because I had to planify every answers/responds interactions but also because the documentation is made id python and perl. When it came the time to get a JavaScript variable from the brain.rive to the script.js, I had a lot of difficulty to find the way to make it possible. This is why I added a Object Macros written in JavaScript in the file directly and after I was able to put it back in the script.js.

In the future, I would like to improv that project. I would like to make it more real by adding much more variables and text in the brain.rive file. Make it seems even more real, to get it as close as Eliza by Joseph Weizenbaum.
