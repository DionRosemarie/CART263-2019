<h1>The <span class="redacted">Grasshopper</span> <br>and the <span class="redacted">Ant</span></h1>
<h2> by <span class="secret">Jean De La Fontaine</span></h2>
</div>

<div>
<br>The Grasshopper, singing
All <span class="secret">summer</span> long,
Now found winter stinging,
<span class="redacted">And ceased in his song</span>.
</div>

<div>
Not a <span class="secret">morsel</span> or crumb in his cupboard–
So he shivered, and ceased in his song.
<span class="redacted">Miss Ant was his neighbor;</span>
To her he went:
"O, you’re rich from labor,
And I’ve not a cent.
</div>

<div>
Lend me food, and I vow <span class="redacted">I’ll return it,
Though at present I have not a cent."</span>
The Ant’s not a <span class="secret">lender,</span>
I must confess.
Her heart’s far from tender
To one in <span class="secret">distress.<span>
</div>

<div>
So she said: "Pray, how passed you the summer,
<span class="redacted">That in winter you come to distress?"</span>
"I sang through the summer,"
Grasshopper said.
"But now I am <span class="secret">glummer</span>
Because I’ve no bread."
"So you sang!" <span class="secret">sneered<span> the Ant. "That relieves me.
Now it’s winter–go dance for your bread!"
